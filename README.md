# Cypheroth
 Automated, extensible toolset that runs cypher queries against Bloodhound's Neo4j backend and saves output to spreadsheets.

### Description

This is a bash script that automates running cypher queries against Bloodhound data stored in a Neo4j database.

I found myself re-running the same queries through the Neo4j web interface on multiple assessments and figured there must be an easier way. ðŸ˜…

The list of cypher queries to run is fully extensible. The formatting example below shows how to add your own.

Please share any additional useful queries so I can add them to this project!

*Fully tested to be working in Bash on Linux, macOS, and Windows*

### Prereqs

* The `cypher-shell` command comes bundled with Neo4j, and is required for this script to function
  * _If Neo4j is installed and `cypher-shell` is not found, you may have an outdated version of Neo4j_
  * _The latest version can always be found at [this location](https://neo4j.com/download-center/)_
  * _On Kali, upgrade to the latest version using [Neo4j's Debian repository](https://debian.neo4j.org)_
* Optional: If the `ssconvert` command is present, the script will combine all .csv output to sheets within a .xls file
  * _Install the gnumeric toolset with apt or brew to gain access to ssconvert_

### Usage

Flags:
```
  -u Neo4J Username (Required)
  -p Neo4J Password (Required)
  -d Fully Qualified Domain Name (Required) (Case Sensitive)
  -a Bolt address (Optional) (Default: localhost:7687)
  -t Query Timeout (Optional) (Default: 30s)
  -v Verbose mode (Optional) (Default:FALSE)
  -h Help text and usage example (Optional)
```
Example with Defaults:

  `./cypheroth.sh -u neo4j -p BloodHound -d TESTLAB.LOCAL`

Example with All Options:

  `./cypheroth.sh -u neo4j -p hunter2 -d BigTech.corp -a 10.0.0.1:7687 -t 5m -v true`


Files are added to a subdirectory named after the FQDN.

### Cypher Queries

There are nearly 60 queries in the script currently. This is a sample of the information you'll receive:

* Full User Property List
* Full Computer Property List
* Full Domain Property List
* Full OU Property List
* Full GPO Property List
* Full Group Property List
* Computers with Admins
* Computers without Admins
* Kerberoastable users and computers where they are admins

To add additional queries, edit the `queries` array within cypheroth.sh and add a line using the following format:

`Description;Cypher Query;Output File`

*If adding a query that requires the Domain value to be set, save it as $DOMAIN.*

Example 1:
```
All Usernames;MATCH (u:User) RETURN u.name;usernames.csv
```

Example 2:
```
All Domain Admins;MATCH (u:User) MATCH (g:Group {name:'DOMAIN ADMINS@$DOMAIN'}) RETURN u.displayname;domainAdmins.csv
```

### Troubleshooting

If you are running an outdated version of `cypher-shell` you may receive the following error:

```
DateTime is not supported as a return type in Bolt protocol version 1.
Please make sure driver supports at least protocol version 2.
Driver upgrade is most likely required.
```

To fix, [update Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download-center/) to the latest version.
